# Slices iOS App

This is the front end for a social media app that I created during my college career.
It allows users to create accounts, follow and unfollow friends, upload and view media.
Each media item can have filters or face tracking images applied to it, and users can
add media as a reaction to another users media.

This was forked, with the API information and version history stripped for security reasons.

## Building and Running

This is being added to my GitHub for the purposes of seeking a job after finishing my schooling.
However, for those wishing to get the project up and running, you will need to do the following:
- Fork and deploy the API either locally, on Heroku or on AWS.
- Enter the API details into the API Helper.
- Build this project with an actual iOS device as the target. The simulator does not have a camera so the main features of the app will not be available.
